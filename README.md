Build a solution in Laravel that allows a backend admin and a frontend user to log into the solution concurrently using Laravel Auth, guards, and middleware. 
it maintain both the admin and the user login sessions separately, meaning if I log in or log out as an admin, it should not be logged in or logged out as a user while using the same browser and vice versa.
